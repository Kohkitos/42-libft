# Libft

## Introduction
This project, **Libft**, is a custom C library containing re-implementations of various standard C functions. Created as part of the 42 curriculum, it serves as a foundational learning exercise in programming and the C language.

## Project Structure
- **`inc/`:** Contains the header file `libft.h`, providing function prototypes and declarations.
- **`src/`:** Includes all the `.c` files comprising the implementations of the custom library functions.
- **`Makefile`:** A build automation script facilitating compilation and project management.
- **`README.md`:** This file, offering a brief overview of the project.

## Functionality
This library encompasses functions across different categories, such as string manipulation, memory management, character operations, and more. Each function has been crafted from scratch to replicate its standard C library counterpart.

## Additional Notes
This project is a fundamental aspect of the 42 curriculum, aiming to strengthen understanding of C programming concepts and standard library functions through the implementation of a custom library.
