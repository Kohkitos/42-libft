# Libft

## Introduction
This project, **Libft**, is a custom C library containing re-implementations of various standard C functions. Created as part of the 42 curriculum, it serves as a foundational learning exercise in programming and the C language.

## Project Structure
Every file is on root by demand, which is quite disgusgting to see for a person with OCD like me, so here's the contents you can see.
- **`libft.h`:** Header file, provides function prototypes and declarations.
- **`*.c*`:** Implementations of the custom library functions.
- **`Makefile`:** A build automation script facilitating compilation and project management.
- **`README.md`:** This file, offering a brief overview of the project.

## Functionality
This library encompasses functions across different categories, such as string manipulation, memory management, character operations, and more. Each function has been crafted from scratch to replicate its standard C library counterpart.

## Additional Notes
This project is a fundamental aspect of the 42 curriculum, aiming to strengthen understanding of C programming concepts and standard library functions through the implementation of a custom library.
